Initial version of the project is written in Python and uses Selenium and Pandas libraries to pull the bracket from the web, process the simulations on the web, 
and then write the results to an Excel sheet where it is automatically formatted into a bracket. In excel you can toggle which rounds are shown.

V2 is still in development. The plan is to create a WPF application that will display the results as a bracket natively as opposed to exporting to an excel sheet. 
Currently the code that simulates the tournament has been completed in C#, but I am only just starting to learn how to create WPF applications.
